dh-cmake (0.3~dev1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Changed dh_cmake_install to use an absolute installation prefix.
  * Changed the dh_ctest_* steps to each do their own submit step, and
    removed dh_ctest_submit from the default ctest sequence. dh_ctest_submit
    still exists, and you can pass --no-submit to the commands to keep the old
    behavior.
  * Added a new --parts argument to dh_ctest_submit to only submit some parts
    to CDash.
  * Added a compat level file, dh-cmake.compat, for future-proofing.
  * Added new "site" and "build" options to DEB_CTEST_OPTIONS to control the
    build and site names submitted to CDash.
  * Changed how the dh_ctest_* commands pass arguments to their dh_auto_*
    counterparts. Instead of passing all their arguments, they only pass the
    "extra" arguments after the "--" argument.
  * Added support for package architectures other than "any" and "all".
  * Added support for the new CPack External generator provided by CPack. This
    allows dh-cmake to install CPack components and component groups in
    specific packages, and use the CPack dependency graph in the output
    packages.

    CDash server.
